# Welcome to my Personal Website!

I originally created this website using Twitter Bootstrap. However, I later decided to rebuild it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a platform that I had never worked with before. But to be honest, I now truly appreciate its capabilities :).

Hugo has made it incredibly easy for me to create, manage, and publish content like what you are seeing here.

## How I deploy the site?

![Deploy](deploy.png)

In my infrastructure, I have two Git repositories. The first one, "personal_website," contains all the Hugo code required to build the site. The second one, "Pamilator.github.io," receives the "public" folder generated during the build, which represents the actual website. I deliberately separated the code from the result, and for now, it's sufficient for my needs.

Feel free to check out my repositories:
- [Pamilator.github.io](https://github.com/Pamilator/Pamilator.github.io)
- [personal_website](https://github.com/Pamilator/personal_website)

Not much more to say for now, but I'm considering purchasing a fancy domain name, something like cedricfamin.me. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸ˜„
